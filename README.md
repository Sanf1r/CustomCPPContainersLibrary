# CustomCPPContainersLibrary

Implementation of the s21_containers.h library.

Tested on MacOS Big Sur 11.6.6.

Made on May 20 2023 as part of my education in School 21 :)

### Introduction

This project implements library with the basic standard C++ container classes: `list`, `stack`, `queue`, `map`, `set`, `multiset`, `vector` and `array`. Implementations provide a full set of standard methods and attributes for element handling, container capacity checking and iteration.

### Information

For most people, the word «container» is self-explanatory and comes from the English word: contain. Same in programming: containers are used to contain sets of objects of the same type i.e elements. However, there are a huge number of container classes. This is because container classes differ in the organisation of stored object sets and in the methods provided to interact with them. So, for example, lists (`list`) store any object, while sets (`set`) store only some unique objects.

The very need to separate containers, rather than using the same one for different tasks, stems not only from obvious functional differences. In some cases, it is more efficient to use lists, e.g. when the task at hand requires frequent insertion of elements in the middle of the container, but when adding new elements at the end only, it is better to use a queue.

Each type of containers should provide the user with the following methods:

- standard constructors (default constructor, copy constructor, move constructor, constructor with initialization list, see materials);

- methods for accessing container elements (e.g. accessing an element with the index i);

- methods for checking if a container is full (e.g. the number of elements in the container, check if the container is empty);

- methods for changing the container (removing and adding new elements, cleaning the container);

- methods for dealing with the container iterator.

Iterators provide an access to container elements. The specific type of iterator will be different for each container. This is because of the different kind of object set organisation in container classes, as well as the actual implementation of the container. Iterators are implemented to work in a similar way that a pointer to an array element in C does. So, this approach with iterators allows interaction with any containers in the same way. Containers provide iterators via the `begin()` and `end()` methods, which point to the first and next after the last elements of the container respectively.

Iterator `iter` has the following operations:

- `*iter`: gets the element pointed to by the iterator;

- `++iter`: moves the iterator forward to the next element

- `--iter`: moves the iterator backwards to the previous element;

- `iter1 == iter2`: two iterators are equal if they point to the same element

- `iter1 != iter2`: two iterators are not equal if they point to different elements

Besides the special organisation of objects and the provision of necessary methods, the implementation of container classes requires the templating of objects.

Template classes or class templates are used when you want to create a class that depends on additional external parameters, which can be other classes or data types. For example, if you need to create a list class, you’ll want to avoid rewriting the list implementation for all possible element types. It would be nice to write one class with a parameter and get several specific list classes at once (character, integer, floating-point, user-defined types lists, etc.).
In C++, containers, along with iterators and some algorithms, are part of the Standard Template Library (STL) for this very reason.

There are two main types of containers: sequence and associative containers. To find an element in sequence containers (`list`, `vector`, `array`, `stack`, `queue`), you have to look through the container one by one, while in associative containers (`map`, `set`, `multiset`) you just need to look through the key associated with the value.
